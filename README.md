## 🛠 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Gemini API errors** | Verify your API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and ensure you're using the correct model name (`gemini-pro` or `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`) |
| **PDF extraction fails** | Replace `PyPDF2` with `pdfplumber`:<br>`pip uninstall PyPDF2`<br>`pip install pdfplumber` |
| **Memory issues** | Reduce `CHUNK_SIZE` in `config.py` (try 200-300 words) and restart the application |
| **FAISS loading errors** | Rebuild the vector store:<br>`rm faiss.index`<br>Then rerun `main.py` |
| **No responses from Gemini** | Check the prompt length (max 30K tokens for `gemini-pro`). Split long contexts into smaller chunks |
| **Missing dependencies** | Ensure all packages are installed:<br>`pip install -r requirements.txt` |



💡 **Pro Tip**: Always check the error logs for detailed messages. Common fixes are often highlighted there.
